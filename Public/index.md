### **`Writting BDD + TDD in my current projects`**

- **Who writes TDD?** tricky question🤔😅. Best case, its the output of a conversation between: devs, product owners/managers, stakeholders, and quality assurance testers
- **What is TDD?**  write software that assumes your production software is already built and make it compile/pass.
- **Why use TDD?** In order to avoid introducing bugs as you are adding or changing behavior.
- **When?** Drill down what you want your users to achieve _as concepts_ first _**[capabilities]**_
- **Where?** TextEdit! 📑 honestly!
- **How to?** Gherkin + Cucumber...ish + XCTest take a look [https://github.com/idelfonsog2/Cucumberish-UnitTest](https://github.com/idelfonsog2/Cucumberish-UnitTest) 👈🏽👀
